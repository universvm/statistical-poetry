# Naive Bayes 

P(m | e) = P(e | m) P(m) / p(e) 

Where:
m = meaning 
e = experiences 

- P(e | m): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z4NS2zdrZc

- P(m): The Mulberry Tree - Vincent van Gogh
 
- P(e): (37.518258, 15.107964)


## Explanation:

The famous and simple equation for Naive Bayes is applied to the context of meaning and experiences. The meaning of life is phrase as P(m | e) "the probability of meaning given the experiences of life". 

This is supported by the P(e | m) "the probability of living the experience given the meaning" or ideals we currently give to our life. I chose Steve Job's "Here's to the crazy ones..." ad speech. It speaks to me as a strong message of meaning that pushes people to do their best, perhaps a little bit "naive" as well. 

The P(m) is the "probability of meaning" in the equation. Here I chose a painting by Vincent van Gogh of a beautiful mulberry tree. The painting was made in 1889, a year before he died, while he was at a mental hospital due to his worsening condition (believed to be Bipolar Disorder). This painting speaks should speak to anyone as the strongest message of a talented painter that even in the most difficult situation is able to show incredible talent (observe the colors!!) to depict a lonely but majestic mulberry tree in autumn. No other painting could signify P(m) more than the Mulberry Tree. 

Finally, the P(e), the probability of experience, is a personal detail.
